# VTT
This is meant to be a simple Open source alternative VTT (Virtual tabletop) application for playing various TTRPG games.


## Development Setup
The current state of this application is meant to be hosted on a Centos Stream 9 server. You'll need a user account with `sudo` permissions in order to set everything up.
This can be done by cloning the repository onto the target server and running:
`./setup/setup.sh` from the repository root. This will install target packages and everything you need to bootstrap a development environment to get this running.
